<h1><center>My past camping trips &amp; photograghy taken throughout the experience.</h1></center>

<P>This camp site was located at Garner State Park, a west Texas state park.<br>
Garner state's water is crystal clear...you can see straight to the bottom with the only obstruction coming from the water's riples. I highly recomend visiting.</P>

<h2>This trip was to <b>Enchanted Rock</b>.</h2>
<article>Enchanted rock is a great mild hiking spot, perfect for beginers.<br>
Along the hike you'll encounter wildlife and enjoy the beautiful views of the west Texas hill country...<br>
..all that fun can make it easy to forget to hydrate, <u>be sure to bring plenty of water</u>!</article>

<img src="images/westtx.jpg" alt="tent" length="300" width="440" height="400">
<p>This photo was taken on a west Texas road trip.<br>
The road trip itself was a spontanious backpacking adventure.<br>
We simply pulled over and camped out on the side of the road.<br>
It is incredibly quiet out there and <em>no civilization for miles.</em></p>
